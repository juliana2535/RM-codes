For our implementation of the Particle Filter, we followed [mpatacchiola](https://github.com/mpatacchiola)'s great [motion tracking module](https://github.com/mpatacchiola/deepgaze/blob/master/deepgaze/motion_tracking.py) which followed the [work of rlabbe](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python). 

For the YOLO, we followed [Nayak's nice tutotrial] (https://www.learnopencv.com/deep-learning-based-object-detection-using-yolov3-with-opencv-python-c/).
